# VKVideoApp: React-Native & Redux example
I've decided to introduce myself with Redux. So there is the test project, that fetches videos from VK by search query.

<br />
##Usage
Download NPM modules:
```
npm install
```
<br />
Change VK token to yours in **config.js** (see [VK Documentation](https://new.vk.com/dev/access_token) for further information):
```
const config = {
  token: 'here is your token',
}
```
<br />
Start explore React, React-Native and Redux!
